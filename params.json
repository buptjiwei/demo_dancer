{"name":"Demo dancer","body":"### Welcome\r\nThis is a very initial implementation of background subtraction and movement tracking modified from an OpenCV example code in **Learning OPENCV**.\r\n\r\nThe distribution contains backgroud substraction codes including average value and codebook methods, and tracking codes of detecting the range of human areas.\r\n\r\nThe system is implemented with C/C++. The software was tested on Windows XP using CodeBLocks ( because my PC with Linux cannot be accessed on weekends)\r\n\r\n###Future work:\r\n1. background subtraction\r\n\tmore powerful algorithms for bg_model training should be used to improve both the efficiency and accuracy.\r\n\teg, the blocks on the door in **\\dancer_forground** are labeled as forground mainly for the shadow of the dancer. Those blocks should be elliminated.\r\n\r\n2. movement tracking\r\n\tThe implementation is a initial one using simple pixel compariation method and have some false alarms in tracking the body. Tracking methods like Optical-Flow and human body detecting systems like HOG-LBP should be used in the future .\r\n\r\nIf you have any problem about the software, codes, license etc., please contact me as soon as possible\r\n\r\n###Dependent software\r\n1. OpenCV: \r\nhttp://www.opencv.org.cn/index.php/Download\r\n2. CodeBlocks:\r\nhttp://www.codeblocks.org/\r\n\r\n###Basic Usage\r\n1. Unpack the code.\r\n2. Compile the c/c++ code with codeblocks\r\n3. Run `./HumanAction.exe begin end dancer.mp4`\r\n4. output: dancer.avi\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJiwei Zhang\r\n###Contact\r\nZhang Jiwei\r\nSchool of Information and Communications Engineering @ BUPT\r\nE-mail: buptjiwei@gmail.com","tagline":"Background Subtraction and Body Tracking  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
